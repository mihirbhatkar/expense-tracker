## Description
+ A new concept for an expense tracker web app using the MERN stack, offering user-friendly expense management and
categorization.
+  Users can add transactions and categorise expenses based on different categories like travel, food, clothing, etc. They
can also search their past transactions from their history.
+  Users get to create multiple “wallets”, allowing them to track expenses for different funds separately. 
+ They also get
assigned an overall “score”, which is based on their overall spending habit in consideration with the monthly spending
limit they have set. 
+ The users can also analyse their spending habits with the help of graphs integrated using Chart.js.
